# Gym Supplement Store â€“ React Project

This is a single-page React application (SPA) I built to simulate an online store for gym supplements. I created this project to practice and demonstrate core React concepts such as routing, component composition, props, state management, and event handling.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Built

- **Multi-page navigation** using React Router, with a shared layout and a persistent navigation bar
- **Product listings** rendered dynamically using `.map()` and reusable `ProductCard` components
- **Props** to pass product data cleanly between components
- **State management** with `useState` to handle UI interactivity (like toggling product visibility)
- **Event handling** to respond to button clicks and user actions
- **Conditional rendering** based on application state
- A clean, modular structure to make it easy to expand and explore React further

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
